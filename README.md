## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery

I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with Daric on an out-of-state project, creating a website aimed at attracting more clients to his small business. Daric, a true patriot at heart, wanted the website to reflect his values of God, Country, and Freedom, which is why we incorporated an American color scheme.

When visitors land on the website, they are greeted with Daric's logo, prominently displayed above the business name, slogan, and call-to-action buttons. Notably, we integrated a captivating video background into this project, featuring an aerial view of the American flag towering over the landscape. Navigation is made seamless through a right-sided menu bar that utilizes jQuery for smooth scrolling to the desired sections. As users continue to scroll, they encounter a section highlighting the core values of the business, featuring picture cards with American stars that smoothly slide into view.

As users scroll down, elegant information boxes about Daric and his business gracefully fade into view alongside captivating images of his work and an embedded custom Google Maps service area. The services section offers a comprehensive array of the services Daric offers to his prospective clients. Moving further down the page, we present customer reviews adorned with images overlaid on a clean white background, giving the page a charming rustic aesthetic.

The website also includes a standard contact form, meticulously designed to cater to the diverse needs of businesses. Similarly, the footer boasts a range of essential components, including social media links and accepted payment methods, making it a one-stop destination for all essential information.

## Optimizations

To enhance the website's loading speed, we optimized image resolutions for select images and minimized unnecessary JavaScript that hindered the website's rendering process. We rely on Google Tag Manager for all our business websites, and while it has caused some rendering issues, we are actively addressing this problem to improve the website's performance.

## Lessons Learned:

Daric's website provided me with valuable experience in developing a cohesive theme for a website and effectively conveying it to potential clientele.
